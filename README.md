I personally prefer to use JOOQ, but according to requirements, I used JPA as much as possible

Department management app written in kotlin. 
JWT with refresh token used for authentication.
Separate service layer for business logic.
Exception handling.
Tests for service layer.
Used flyway for migrations.
Dockerfile.
Automatic jooq code generation and flyway migrations configured.
